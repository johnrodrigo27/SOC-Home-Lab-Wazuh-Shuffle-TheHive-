# Step 5: Configuring Wazuh

This step involves adding agents to the Wazuh server for monitoring and managing security events from your client machines. Follow these instructions to configure Wazuh agents on your client devices.

## 1. Login to Wazuh Dashboard

- Access the Wazuh Dashboard through `https://public-ip-address-of-wazuh-server`.
- You might encounter a message indicating, "No agents were added to this manager," which is expected at this stage.

## 2. Add an Agent

1. Navigate to the section for adding an agent.
2. Choose the type of machine you're adding (e.g., Linux, Windows, MacOS).
3. Enter the server address: `wazuh-public-ip-address`.
4. In the optional settings, you can assign a name to your agent for easier identification.
5. Copy the provided commands. These will be used for installing the Wazuh agent on your client machine.

## 3. Install Wazuh Agent on Client Machine

1. On your client machine, open PowerShell in administrator mode.
2. Paste the commands you copied from the Wazuh Dashboard and press [Enter] to execute them.
3. Once the installation is complete, start the Wazuh service by executing `NET START WazuhSvc`.

By following these steps, your client machine will begin reporting security events to the Wazuh server, integrating it into your SOC Home Lab's monitoring ecosystem.

## Retrieving Forgotten Wazuh Password
