# Step 3: Creating a Cloud Server for TheHive

This step-by-step guide will help you set up a dedicated virtual machine for TheHive on Digital Ocean. It covers the creation of the VM, securing it behind a firewall, accessing it via SSH, and installing necessary dependencies and TheHive itself.

## 1. Log into Digital Ocean Account

Ensure you're logged into your [Digital Ocean account](https://www.digitalocean.com/).

## 2. Creating a Droplet for TheHive Server

1. Click "Create" in the top right corner and select "Droplets".
2. For the operating system, choose "Ubuntu version 22.04 (LTS) x64".
3. Select "Basic" for the Droplet type.
4. Opt for a memory and disk space configuration of 8GB Memory and 160GB SSDs (suggested price at $48/mo) to ensure smooth operation.
5. Establish access credentials by either creating a password or setting up SSH keys. Store the password securely, ideally in a password manager.
6. Customize the "Hostname" to your preference.
7. Finalize the process by clicking "Create Droplet".

## 3. Configuring Firewall for Security

1. From the left-hand menu, select "Droplets" and then click on your server's name.
2. Navigate to "Networking".
3. Scroll down to "Firewalls", click "Edit".
4. In the firewall settings, add your newly created droplet by selecting the appropriate firewall, clicking on "Add Droplet", typing the server's hostname, selecting it, and then confirming by clicking "Add Droplet".

## 4. Accessing the Virtual Machine via SSH

1. Obtain the VM's public IP address.
2. On your local machine, open a command terminal (CMD).
3. Connect via SSH using `ssh root@<public-ip-address-of-thehive-server>`. Enter the password or use the SSH key when prompted.

## 5. Installing TheHive

Follow the below steps to install TheHive and its dependencies:

### Install Dependencies

```bash
apt install wget gnupg apt-transport-https git ca-certificates ca-certificates-java curl software-properties-common python3-pip lsb-release
```

### Install Java

```bash
wget -qO- https://apt.corretto.aws/corretto.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/corretto.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/corretto.gpg] https://apt.corretto.aws stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/corretto.sources.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install java-common java-11-amazon-corretto-jdk
echo JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-amazon-corretto" | sudo tee -a /etc/environment 
export JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-amazon-corretto"
```

### Install Cassandra

```bash
wget -qO - https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/KEYS | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/cassandra-archive.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/cassandra-archive.gpg] https://debian.cassandra.apache.org 40x main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cassandra.sources.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install cassandra
```

### Install Elasticsearch

```bash
wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/elasticsearch-keyring.gpg
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/elasticsearch-keyring.gpg] https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/7.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-7.x.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install elasticsearch
```

#### Elasticsearch JVM Options

If Elasticsearch fails to run due to Out of Memory (OOM) issues, adjust the JVM settings to allocate more memory:

```bash
# Create or edit the jvm.options file under /etc/elasticsearch/jvm.options.d/
# Add the following configurations:
-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true
-Xms2g
-Xmx2g
```

### Install TheHive

```bash
wget -O- https://archives.strangebee.com/keys/strangebee.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/strangebee-archive-keyring.gpg
echo 'deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/strangebee-archive-keyring.gpg] https://deb.strangebee.com thehive-5.2 main' | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/strangebee.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y thehive
```

Follow these steps carefully to ensure a successful setup of TheHive on your Digital Ocean VM. For detailed instructions and troubleshooting, refer to the official [TheHive documentation](https://docs.strangebee.com/thehive/setup/installation/step-by-step-guide/#cortex-misp).
