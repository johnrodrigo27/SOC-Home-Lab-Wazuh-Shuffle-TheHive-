# Step 1: Installing Sysmon on Clients

Sysmon (System Monitor) is a Windows system service and device driver that, once installed on a system, remains resident across system reboots to monitor and log system activity to the Windows event log. It provides detailed information about process creations, network connections, and changes to file creation time. Installing Sysmon with a well-configured ruleset enhances the visibility into advanced threats and helps in early detection of malicious activity on client devices.

## Downloading and Installing Sysmon

### 1. Download Sysmon

First, download Sysmon from the official Microsoft Sysinternals site. This tool is continually updated to address new Windows features and threat detection capabilities.

- **Download Link**: [Sysmon on Microsoft Sysinternals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon)

### 2. Extract the Zip File

Once downloaded, extract the zip file to a desired location on your system. This location will be used to run the Sysmon installation command.

### 3. Download Sysmon Configuration File

A well-configured Sysmon configuration file is crucial for maximizing the effectiveness of Sysmon's monitoring capabilities. The Sysmon Modular project on GitHub provides a comprehensive, community-driven configuration file.

- **Configuration File Download Steps**:
    1. Visit the GitHub link: [Sysmon Modular Configuration](https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular/blob/master/sysmonconfig.xml)
    2. Download a raw copy of the Sysmon configuration file.
    3. Save the configuration file in the same location where you extracted Sysmon.

### 4. Installing Sysmon

With Sysmon and the configuration file ready, you can proceed with the installation.

1. **Open PowerShell in Administration Mode**:
    - Right-click the Start button.
    - Select “Windows PowerShell (Admin)” or “Command Prompt (Admin)” if PowerShell is not available.

2. **Navigate to the Sysmon Folder**:
    - Use the `cd` command to change directories to where you have extracted Sysmon.

3. **Run the Installation Command**:
    - Execute the following command:
      ```
      ./sysmon64.exe -i sysmonconfig.xml
      ```
    - This command installs Sysmon and applies the configuration rules defined in `sysmonconfig.xml`.

### Post-Installation Steps

- **Verify Installation**: Check the Windows Event Viewer under "Applications and Services Logs" > "Microsoft" > "Windows" > "Sysmon" to see the operational log and confirm Sysmon is actively logging events.
- **Customize Configuration** (Optional): Modify the `sysmonconfig.xml` file as needed to adjust the monitoring rules to your specific needs. Re-apply the configuration using the `-c` flag with Sysmon.

### Best Practices

- **Regularly Update Configuration**: As new threats emerge, updating your Sysmon configuration to reflect these changes is crucial for maintaining optimal monitoring.
- **Secure Configuration File**: Ensure the configuration file is stored securely, preventing unauthorized modifications that could blind your monitoring capabilities.
- **Review Logs Regularly**: Make it a habit to review Sysmon logs regularly or integrate them with a centralized logging solution for better visibility and threat detection.
