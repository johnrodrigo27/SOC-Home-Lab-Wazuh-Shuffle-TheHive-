# Step 4: Configuring TheHive Server

This guide details the configuration steps required for TheHive server, including setting up Cassandra and Elasticsearch, which are critical for TheHive's operation. We'll walk through editing configuration files, managing service statuses, and ensuring the correct permissions and settings for TheHive to function properly.

## 1. Configuring Cassandra

Cassandra's configuration is crucial for TheHive to store its data effectively.

### Edit Cassandra Configuration

1. Open the Cassandra configuration file for editing:
   ```bash
   nano /etc/cassandra/cassandra.yaml
   ```
2. Modify the following settings in the file:
   - `cluster_name`: Set this to any name you prefer.
   - `listen_address`: Set this to your TheHive public IP address.
   - `rpc_address`: Also set this to your TheHive public IP address.
   - Under `seed_provider`, set `seeds` to "thehive-public-ip-address:7000".
   
   Use `Ctrl+W` to search for specific strings in nano, and save your changes with `Ctrl+X`, then press `Y` and `Enter`.

### Reset Cassandra Data

If Cassandra has started before being properly configured, follow these steps:

1. Stop Cassandra:
   ```bash
   systemctl stop cassandra
   ```
2. Remove existing data:
   ```bash
   rm -rf /var/lib/cassandra/*
   ```
3. Restart Cassandra and check its status:
   ```bash
   systemctl start cassandra.service
   systemctl status cassandra.service
   ```

To exit the status screen, press `q`.

## 2. Configuring Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is integral for indexing and searching within TheHive.

### Edit Elasticsearch Configuration

1. Open the Elasticsearch configuration file:
   ```bash
   nano /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml
   ```
2. Update the following settings:
   - Uncomment `cluster_name` and set it as desired.
   - Uncomment `node.name` and keep the node name.
   - Uncomment `network.host` and set it to your TheHive public IP address.
   - Uncomment `http.port`.
   - Uncomment `cluster.initial_master_nodes` and adjust as necessary (usually keeping `node-1` and removing `node-2` is sufficient).

Consider uncommenting `discovery.seed_hosts` if planning to scale.

3. Save the changes and exit nano.
4. Start and enable Elasticsearch:
   ```bash
   systemctl start elasticsearch.service
   systemctl enable elasticsearch.service
   systemctl status elasticsearch.service
   ```

## 3. Configuring TheHive

Finally, configure TheHive to use these services.

### Set Permissions

Ensure TheHive has access to necessary directories:

1. Check current permissions:
   ```bash
   ls -la /opt/thp
   ```
2. Update access permissions:
   ```bash
   chown -R thehive:thehive /opt/thp
   ```
3. Verify the updated permissions:
   ```bash
   ls -la /opt/thp
   ```

### Edit TheHive Configuration

1. Open TheHive's configuration file:
   ```bash
   nano /etc/thehive/application.conf
   ```
2. Update the database and index configurations:
   - For "storage", set `hostname` to your TheHive public IP address and adjust `cluster-name` to match the Cassandra cluster name.
   - For "index.search", set `hostname` to your TheHive public IP address.
   - Update `application.baseUrl` to "http://thehive-public-ip-address:9000".

3. Save your changes and exit nano.

### Start TheHive

1. Start TheHive service and enable it to run at boot:
   ```bash
   systemctl start thehive
   systemctl enable thehive
   ```

## 4. Logging into TheHive

Access TheHive through your web browser by navigating to `http://public-ip-address-of-thehive-server:9000/login`. Use the default credentials `admin@thehive.local` and password `secret` to log in.

By completing these configurations, you have prepared TheHive for operation within your SOC Home Lab. Remember to replace placeholder values such as `thehive-public-id-address` with actual IP addresses or hostnames used in your setup.
