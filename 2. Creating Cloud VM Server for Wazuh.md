# Step 2: Creating Cloud VM for Wazuh

This guide walks you through setting up virtual machines on Digital Ocean to host the Wazuh server and TheHive for your SOC Home Lab. We'll start by creating a Digital Ocean account, proceed with creating a droplet for the Wazuh server, and secure our servers with a firewall. 

## Creating a Digital Ocean Account

1. Visit [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) and sign up for a new account if you do not already have one.

## Creating a Droplet for the Wazuh Server

1. Once logged in, click on "Create" in the top right corner, and select "Droplets" from the dropdown menu.
2. For the OS, select "Ubuntu version 22.04 (LTS) x64".
3. Choose "Basic" for the Droplet type.
4. Select a plan with at least 8GB of Memory and 160GB SSD storage (e.g., $48/mo option) to ensure adequate performance.
5. Configure your access credentials. You can choose either a password or SSH keys. If you opt for a password, ensure it's stored securely, such as in a password manager.
6. Customize the "Hostname" of the droplet to your preference.
7. Click on "Create Droplet" at the bottom of the page to initiate the droplet's setup.

## Setting Up a Firewall

1. Navigate to the "Networking" section from the left-hand side menu.
2. Select the "Firewalls" tab and click on "Create Firewall".
3. Give your firewall a name.
4. In "Inbound Rules", select "All TCP" and specify the source as the IP address of the machine you'll use to access the Wazuh, Shuffle, and TheHive servers. This limits access to your servers, enhancing security.
5. Click on "Create Firewall" to finalize the setup.

## Configuring Servers to Use the Firewall

1. Go back to the "Droplets" menu from the left-hand side.
2. Click on your server's name, then select "Networking".
3. Scroll to find "Firewalls", click "Edit".
4. In the "Firewalls" tab, choose the firewall you created.
5. Under "Droplets", click on "Add Droplets", search for your server's hostname, select it, and click "Add Droplet".

## Accessing the Virtual Machine via SSH

1. Retrieve the public IP address of your virtual machine.
2. On your local Windows machine, open Command Prompt (CMD).
3. Use the command: `ssh root@vm-public-ip-address`, and when prompted, enter the password you set up or your SSH key.

## Updating and Upgrading VM Servers

Once logged in to your VM, it's good practice to update and upgrade the system packages:

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
```

Follow any prompts that appear during the update and upgrade process by pressing [Enter].

## Installing Wazuh 4.7

To install Wazuh on your VM, follow these commands:

```bash
curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.7/wazuh-install.sh && sudo bash ./wazuh-install.sh -a
```

- Ensure you note down the username and password provided at the end of the Wazuh installation logs, as these credentials are required to log in to the Wazuh web interface.

## Logging into Wazuh

- Access the Wazuh dashboard by navigating to `https://public-ip-address-of-wazuh-server` in your web browser.

This comprehensive guide provides a foundational setup for your SOC Home Lab, focusing on the deployment of Wazuh and TheHive on cloud VMs securely. Make sure to follow each step carefully to ensure a successful and secure installation.
