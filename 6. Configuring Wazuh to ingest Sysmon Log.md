# Step 6: Configuring Wazuh to Ingest Sysmon Logs

This guide details the process for configuring a Wazuh agent on a client machine to ingest logs from Sysmon, enhancing your SOC Home Lab's monitoring capabilities with detailed event data. Follow these steps to ensure Sysmon logs are properly forwarded to your Wazuh server.

## 1. Back Up Wazuh Agent Configuration

- On the client machine where the Wazuh agent and Sysmon are installed, navigate to `C:\Program Files (x86)\ossec-agent`.
- Create a backup of the `ossec.conf` file. This step is crucial for restoring the original configuration if necessary.

## 2. Modify Wazuh Agent Configuration

1. Open Notepad as an administrator.
2. Open the `ossec.conf` file located in the Wazuh agent's installation directory (`C:\Program Files (x86)\ossec-agent`).
3. Locate the section labeled "Log analysis" within the file.

## 3. Add Sysmon as a Source of Logs

1. Within the "Log analysis" section, add a new `<localfile>` block to specify Sysmon logs as a source:
   ```xml
   <localfile>
       <location>Application</location>
       <log_format>eventchannel</log_format>
   </localfile>
   ```
2. You'll need to update the `<location>` with the Sysmon channel name. To find this:

   - Open Event Viewer on the client machine.
   - Navigate to `Application and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > Sysmon`.
   - Right-click on the "Operational" log and select "Properties".
   - In the "General" tab, note the "Full Name" of the log (e.g., `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`).

3. Update the `<localfile>` entry in `ossec.conf` with the Sysmon channel name:
   ```xml
   <localfile>
       <location>Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational</location>
       <log_format>eventchannel</log_format>
   </localfile>
   ```

## 4. Restart Wazuh Service

- To apply the configuration changes, restart the Wazuh service on the client machine:
  - Press the Start button, type "services", and open the Services application.
  - Locate the "Wazuh" service, right-click it, and select "Restart".

Following these steps configures the Wazuh agent to ingest and forward Sysmon logs to your Wazuh server, providing detailed insights into the operational events on the client machine. This configuration enhances the visibility and monitoring capabilities of your SOC Home Lab.
