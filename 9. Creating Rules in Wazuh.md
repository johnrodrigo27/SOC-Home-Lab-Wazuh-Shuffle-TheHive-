# Step 9: Creating Rules in Wazuh

Creating custom rules in Wazuh allows for the detection of specific events or activities based on log data. This step guides you through creating a rule to detect a specific event, such as the execution of Mimikatz, by leveraging Sysmon logs.

## 1. Access Wazuh Dashboard

Log in to the Wazuh dashboard using your preferred web browser.

## 2. Navigate to Rule Management

1. Click on the dropdown icon next to "wazuh" at the top of the dashboard.
2. Select **Management** > **Rules** > **Manage Rule Files**.

## 3. Copy an Existing Rule Format

1. Use the search tab within the rule management section and type "sysmon" then press enter to filter the rules.
2. View and copy the content of the first entry, such as `0800-sysmon_id_1.xml`, to use as a template. The example provided demonstrates how to structure a rule:
   
   ```xml
   <rule id="92000" level="4">
       <if_group>sysmon_event1</if_group>
       <field name="win.eventdata.parentImage" type="pcre2">(?i)\\(c|w)script\.exe</field>
       <options>no_full_log</options>
       <description>Scripting interpreter spawned a new process</description>
       <mitre>
           <id>T1059.005</id>
       </mitre>
   </rule>
   ```

## 4. Create a Custom Rule

1. Navigate back to **Management** > **Rules** > **Manage Rules**.
2. Click the **Custom rules** button located at the end of the search bar.
3. Edit the `local_rules.xml` file.
4. Paste the copied rule format at the end of the rule file and update the details to reflect the specific event you wish to detect. For instance, to detect Mimikatz execution:
   
   ```xml
   <rule id="100002" level="15">
       <if_group>sysmon_event1</if_group>
       <field name="win.eventdata.originalFileName" type="pcre2">(?i)mimikatz\.exe</field>
       <description>Mimikatz Usage Detected</description>
       <mitre>
           <id>T1003</id>
       </mitre>
   </rule>
   ```

Ensure you assign a unique `id` to your custom rule that doesn't conflict with existing rule IDs. The `level` attribute defines the severity of the rule, and the `<field>` element specifies the log data to match, with `type="pcre2"` indicating the use of Perl Compatible Regular Expressions.

By following these steps, you have successfully added a custom rule to your Wazuh deployment. This rule will help detect specific events, enhancing your SOC Home Lab's monitoring and alerting capabilities.
